# ICAREdata Submission Procedures

version 0.1

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

## Introduction

### Purpose
This document outlines the submission procedures and data expectations for the ICAREdataâ„¢ Study.  The interface leverages [FHIR Messaging](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/messaging.html)

### Target Audiance and Exceptations 
The primary audiance for this document are those that are directly involved in the ICAREdata Study data submission process, though the content is relevant for anyone involved in the study itself. 

This document relies heavily on the reader having a basic understanding of the HL7 FHIR specification. The document does not provide an overview of the FHIR specification and will only explain the use of FHIR within the realm of the ICAREdata Study. 

### Scope
This document outlines the supported data formats for the system, data content epectations, submission protocols and authorization mechanisms. 

This document does not describe the procedures or mechanisms for integrating with an ICAREdata Study site's electronic health record (EHR) or other systems.  The document also does not describe any processing required to transform the data into a format that is compatible with the data submission server. These tasks are site-specific in nature and as such are outside of the scope of this document. 

### Assumptions
1. This document assumes FHIR Specification [R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/timelines.html). It is envisioned that other FHIR versions may be supported at some time in the future, when that support is added this documentation will be updated to reflect that fact. 

## Technical Approach
The ICAREdata Study submission infrastrucure will use a FHIR messaging based approach.  


### Message Definition
The icare-data-study message is a FHIR Message sent by a participating ICAREdata Study site to report data gathered about a clinical trial subject to the ICAREdata submission infrastucture. 


#### Message Structure

The general structure of the icare-data-study message is presented below. Please note that the constraints for mCODE and ICAREdata Study Implementation Guides (IG) entries are not included below as they are described in detail within each of the aforementioned IGs.

See the FHIR Specification for the data type definitions and optional elements for the resources used in the icare-data-submission message.

- [Bundle](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/bundle.html)
- [MessageHeader](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/messageheader.html)


See the Implementation Guides for mCODE and ICAREdata Study for constraints of the individual data entries. 

- [mCODE](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/fhir-mCODE-ig/)
- [ICAREdata Study](http://build.fhir.org/ig/standardhealth/fsh-icare/)


The message header will contain a single data element that reference a Parameters resource that appears in an entry element in the message. The Parameters resource provides information that about the clinical trial and the clinical trial subject that the message pertains too.  

#### Example Message

- Example ICAREdata Submission message: [JSON](icare-data-submission-request-json-example.md) 


### icare-data-study response
When the ICAREdata Study submission infrastructure accepts and processes a data submission request, the response message will contain a Message Header with response code value, "ok".

When the ICAREdata Study submission infrastucutre rejects a data submission request, the MessageHeader will have the response code value, "fatal-error" and reference an [OperationOutcome](http://hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/operationoutcome.html) resource contained in another entry in the bundle.

The OperationOutcome will have issue severity value, "error" and an issue code value from the value set, [issue-type](http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/valueset-issue-type.html). The issue code provides ICAREdata Study clients with information about why the submission infrastructure did not process the request. Human-friendly text that complements the issue code may also be provided in an issue details element.

## Message Delivery Mechanism
Section [3.4.3](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/messaging.html#process) of the FHIR Specification defines a process for handling FHIR Messages via the $process-message operation. The specification outlines both synchrnous and ansynchrnouse means of submitting the messages to a FHIR server for processing. For the purposes of data submission in the ICAREdata Study infrasturcture, only synchronous messaging will be supported and as such the submission server will expect messages to be submitted following the this guidance in the FHIR specification. 

Future versions of the submission infrastucture may support asynchronous messaging and at such time this documentation will be updated to reflect those procedures. 

### Content Type
While the FHIR specification supports both JSON and XML as primary data protocols the ICAREdata Study submission infrasturucture will support only JSON based interactions. 


### Security Implementation Guidance
For the purposes of authorizing site clients to the ICAREdata infrastucutre the submission services will support the protocols outlined in the SMART Backend Services: Authorization Guide. The submssion infrastructure will be acting as a FHIR server for this purpose and will implment the server side of the protocol.  Site clients will be required to implment the client side of the protocol. 

### Client registration
Clients for participating sites wioll be manually registered in the ICAREdata infrastuctures OAuth2 server. Sites participating in the ICAREdata Study will be provided with the client identifiers and authentication/authorization credentials.
